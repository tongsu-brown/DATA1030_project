# Thin-Film Stress Prediction with Machine Learning (DATA 1030 Final Project)

This repository contains the code and report for my DATA 1030 final project, where I apply supervised machine learning to predict **stress-thickness** behavior in thin films from process and material parameters.

The goal is to:
- Build and evaluate regression models (e.g. Gradient Boosting) to predict stress-thickness.
- Analyze feature importance and model behavior using tools like SHAP.
- Provide a fully reproducible pipeline from raw data to figures and final results.
- Provide the prototype for the universal thin film stress model
